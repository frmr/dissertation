The contents of this directory will be in the working directory when copied to
the host machine. Below is a description of each scripts, followed by
a list of commands that should be executed to repeat the trials described in
the project report.

Script      Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
benchh      "Benchmark on Host". Run all benchmarks on the host machine. Note
            that the benchmarks must be compiled first.
benchm      "Benchmark on MIC". Run all benchmarks on the Xeon Phi. Note that
            this script must be copied to the Xeon Phi first and run in the same
            directory as the benchmarks. Benchmarks must also be compile first.
cpm         "Copy to MIC". Copy files listed in the arguments to mic0.
            Usage: ./cpm <file0> <file1> ... <fileN>
get         Copy all contents of the "results" folder on mic0 to the
            "results" folder in this directory.
runh        "Run on Host". Run the program passed as an argument on the host
            machine. This script sets the environment path for accessing a
            required Intel library.
            Usage: ./runh <executable>
runm        "Run on MIC". Run the program passed as an argument on the host
            machine. This script sets the environment path for accessing a
            required Intel library.
            Usage: ./runm <executable>
sshm        "SSH to MIC". Connect to mic0 using the SSH protocol. Also copies
            benchm, runm and two required Intel libraries to mic0.
vtune       Run Intel VTune Amplifier XE. See VTune Amplifier documentation for
            more information.
            Usage: ./vtune <arg0> <arg1> ... <argN>



To rerun the benchmarks described in the project report, run the following
commands, starting in this directory:

    cd benchmarks
    ./build
    cd ..
    ./cpm benchmarks results
    ./sshm
    ./benchm
    exit
    ./get
    ./benchh
